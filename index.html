		<p><img border="0" src="images\shawn_alaska1.jpg" width="250" align="left" hspace="20" alt="Catching my first arctic grayling in Alaska" title="Catching my first arctic grayling in Alaska">I am originally from a small rural community located northeast of Cincinnati, Ohio.  After graduating from high school, I headed west to Fort Collins, Colorado, where I attended <a href="http://www.colostate.edu" target="_blank">Colorado State University</a> on an Army ROTC scholarship and studied Wildlife Biology and Range Ecology.  After graduating with a Bachelor's of Science degree in 1990, I began a short five-year career in the U.S. Army as a <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/200797/combat_engineers_enable_infantry_commanders_soldiers" target="_blank">combat engineer</a> officer.  Most of my time in the Army was spent at Fort Riley, where I served as a platoon leader and company executive officer in the 1st Engineer Battalion before moving on to a staff officer position in operations (an Assistant S3 for those who know what that is) with the <a href="https://home.army.mil/riley/" target="_blank">1st Infantry Division</a> Engineer Brigade.  In 1995, I resigned my commission and began work on a Master's degree in Geography at <a href="http://www.ksu.edu" target="_blank">Kansas State University</a> with the help of a Department of Defense Environmental Fellowship.  After finishing in 1997, I continued in Geography at Kansas State and entered the Ph.D. program with funding through a NASA Earth Systems Science Fellowship.  I successfully defended my dissertation in 2000 and am a proud member of the inaugural class of K-State geography Ph.D. graduates.  After living for a couple of years in Athens, Georgia (home of <a href="https://www.remhq.com/" target="_blank">REM</a>...one of my favorite bands), my wife and I returned to Manhattan in August 2000 to join the faculty of Kansas State University.  We have been here ever since!</p>

I teach courses in the field of Geographic Information Science (GIScience) including GEOG 508 (GIS 1), GEOG 602 (Computer Mapping and Geographic Visualization), GEOG 608 (GIS 2), GEOG 712 (Internet GIS and Distributed GIServices), GEOG 728 (Programming for Geographic Analysis), and GEOG 808 (Geocomputation).  I also serve as the director of the <a href="http://catalog.k-state.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=12912" target="_blank">Undergraduate Certificate in GIS</a>, the <a href="http://catalog.k-state.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=41&poid=13347" target="_blank">Graduate Certificate in GIScience</a>, and the <a href="http://www.ksu.edu/nres" target="_blank">Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences (NRES) Secondary Major</a>.  In my capacity as a professor at Kansas State, I have been able to travel all over the world and have worked in China, France, Mexico, Paraguay, and Senegal.  I am looking for any excuse at all to travel to Australia and Antarctica to complete the seven continents!</p>

		<p><img border="0" src="images/hutchinson_costarica.jpg" width="250" align="left" hspace="20" alt="Whitewater rafting in Costa Rica" title="Whitewater rafting in Costa Rica">I have been married since 1997 to <a href="https://engg.k-state.edu/about/people/hutchinson/" target="_blank">Stacy Lewis Hutchinson</a> (Associate Dean for Research, College of Engineering) and we have two children, Mitch (age 21) and Marleigh (age 19).  My son Mitch is a senior at K-State majoring in Computer Science.  Marleigh is a sophomore  at K-State studying Environmental Engineering.  Whenever possible, I try to spend a few weeks each year flyfishing for trout in western Montana and scuba diving in the Caribbean.  When I'm in Manhattan (and not working), I can be found playing with our labrador retrievers Mocha and Maizy or watching <a href="http://www.nhl.com" target="_blank">NHL</a> hockey, <a href="http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb.html" target="_blank">English Premiere League</a>, or <a href="https://www.mlssoccer.com" target="_blank">Major League Soccer</a> at home.  I'm always happy to talk about the 2021-2022 Stanley Cup champions <a href="https://www.nhl.com/avalanche" target="_blank">Colorado Avalanche</a>, <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/en" target="_blank">Chelsea</a>, or <a href="https://www.sportingkc.com/" target="_blank">Sporting KC</a>!  I'm also a huge fan of the <a href="http://www.callofduty.com" target="_blank">Call of Duty</a> video game series.  If you play, you can friend me by using my PS4 handle "The--Geographer".  During weekends, Stacy and I like to spend time in our loft in the <a href="https://kcrivermarket.com/" target="_blank">River Market neighborhood<a> in downtown Kansas City and ride the <a href="https://kcstreetcar.org/" target="_blank">KC Streetcar</a> up and down Main Street exploring fun places to eat and drink!</p>
